# Matlab-code-for-individual-project
 The images generated by MATLAB code used in the individual project titled "Simulating Dual-Mode Terahertz Laser Emission Using Broadband Photonic Techniques."

##Project Overview
This project involves simulating dual-mode terahertz (THz) laser emission using Fabry–Pérot (FP) cavities and aperiodic distributed feedback (ADFB) gratings. The MATLAB code generates simulations to replicate experimental results, helping to analyze and understand frequency fine-tuning in THz quantum cascade lasers (QCLs).

##System Requirements
MATLAB (version 2023 or later recommended)
MATLAB toolboxes for signal processing and data analysis

##Project Structure
Source Code: The MATLAB files used for simulations.
Experimental Data: Data from experiments that the simulations aim to replicate.
Output Images: Graphs and plots generated by the MATLAB code.

##Installation and Setup
Clone the Repository: Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.
bash
Copy code
Open MATLAB: Launch MATLAB on your local machine.
Navigate to the Project Folder: Use the "Current Folder" panel in MATLAB to locate the cloned repository.

##Running the MATLAB Code
Load the Code: Open the desired MATLAB file (e.g., EP7RE.m) from the project folder.
Execute the Script: Click the "Run" button in the MATLAB editor or type the file name in the command window.
View the Output: The code generates plots and graphs illustrating the frequency response and other characteristics.

##Troubleshooting
Error Messages: If you encounter errors, check for syntax issues or missing dependencies.
Unexpected Output: Review the code and confirm that the input parameters are correct.
